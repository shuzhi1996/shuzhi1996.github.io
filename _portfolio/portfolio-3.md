title: "方向三：The driving force behind topology optimization"
excerpt: "I hope I can make a small contribution to the development of the topology optimization community. Make it easier for everyone to use topology optimization programs to achieve various wonderful designs. For example, on your laptop, it takes one to two hours to implement a large-scale design :).<br/><br/><img src='/images/封面.png'>"

Large-scale topology optimization design solution based on MATLAB environment. 
MATLAB is one of the most user-friendly platforms for beginners in computational mechanics. Its powerful matrix operations and timely visibility are perfect for algorithm development, debugging, and learning! However, behind such intuitiveness and convenience, there must be sacrifices. For example, MATLAB can provide very little help in solving large-scale linear equations. Perhaps we can call right division directly, or use official MATLAB functions such as PCG and GMERS. However, they fall far short of what we need. We need more advanced methods.
